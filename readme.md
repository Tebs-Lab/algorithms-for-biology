# Algorithms for Biology Workshops

This repository is a collection of materials designed to run workshops teaching the basics of bioinformatics. It is most relevant to students of biology who are beginning to learn how to program, but it may also be useful to programmers who would like to learn biology. 

If you fall into the second camp, or just need a refresher on the basics of genetics, consider starting with this article describing some of the most important (and fundamental) genetics topics [What Is A Gene, and How Do Programmers Read Them?](https://medium.com/tebs-lab/genetics-101-what-exactly-is-a-gene-b4bd0c5977ae)

## Using This Repo

Each folder on this main level (currently there is only `big-o`) has materials for a single workshop. Each workshop has it's own readme describing how best to use those materials.
